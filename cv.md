## About Me

**Hello!** I am 25 years old, I work at the same type of work, where there is no goal for development in life. I liked the principle of the front-end developer. I like learning new information and exercising my brain on new tasks. I want to get a new stage in my life, which I am sure will lead me to the desired results.
**Such as:**
1. **Travel**
2. **Self-development**
3. **New meetings**
4. **Teamwork**
   
**and much more...**
